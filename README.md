### How to build ###

1. Node.js is needed to build. So you must install node first.
2. Install grunt-cli(grunt command line inteface) by running "npm install -g grunt-cli". Notice that the grunt-cli is installed globally. Run this by adding "sudo" if necessary.
3. In the root folder of the project, run "npm install" to install all node packages needed for building this project.
4. In the root folder of the project, run "grunt" to build. The output files will appear in the build folder.
